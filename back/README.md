Hawk Eventing
===============

This is a plugin very similar to the [Falcone-Util plugin](http://grails.org/plugin/falcone-util), but without the Hibernate integration. 
The main goal of the plugin is to provide a very simple, non intrusive message broker.

The documentation is hosted at [GitHub Pages](http://multi-tenant.github.com/grails-hawk-eventing/)
