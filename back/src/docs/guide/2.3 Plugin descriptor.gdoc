You can register events in the plugin descriptor. By adding a doWithEvents closure. The DSL is the same as the one used in events.groovy.

{code:java}
def doWithEvents = { ApplicationContext ctx ->

    hibernate.book.created { Event event -> 
        // Do something with event.payload
    }

}
{code}
