The plugin is based on [Falcone Util|http://grails.org/plugin/falcone-util].

h3. Why another plugin? 

Falcone Util is not actively maintained and contains a lot of code from another project. 

h3. Why not update Falcone Util instead of creating yet another plugin?

People still use and depend on the code in Falcone Util.
